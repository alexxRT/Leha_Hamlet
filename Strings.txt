429  [He may approve our eyes and speak to it.]
430  [He may not, as unvalued persons do,]
431  [He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.]
432  [Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,]
433  [Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,]
434  [Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads]
435  [His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!]
436  [His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,]
437  [His further gait herein, in that the levies,]
438  [His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;]
439  [Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;]
440  [Hold you the watch to-night?]
441  [Holding a weak supposal of our worth,]
442  [Holds such an enmity with blood of man]
443  [Horatio! – or I do forget myself.]
444  [Horatio. 'Tis here!]
445  [Horatio. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.]
446  [Horatio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.]
447  [Horatio. A piece of him.]
448  [Horatio. A truant disposition, good my lord. 375]
449  [Horatio. And then it started, like a guilty thing]
450  [Horatio. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;]
451  [Horatio. As thou art to thyself. 75]
452  [Horatio. Be rul'd. You shall not go.]
453  [Horatio. Before my God, I might not this believe]
454  [Horatio. Do not, my lord!]
455  [Horatio. Do, if it will not stand.]
456  [Horatio. Friends to this ground.]
457  [Horatio. Good my lord, tell it.]
458  [Horatio. Have after. To what issue will this come?]
459  [Horatio. Hail to your lordship! 365]
460  [Horatio. He waxes desperate with imagination. 725]
461  [Horatio. Heaven secure him!]
462  [Horatio. Heaven will direct it.]
463  [Horatio. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.]
464  [Horatio. I think it lacks of twelve.]
465  [Horatio. I warr'nt it will.]
466  [Horatio. In faith,]
467  [Horatio. In what particular thought to work I know not;]
468  [Horatio. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon. 385]
469  [Horatio. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season]
470  [Horatio. It beckons you to go away with it,]
471  [Horatio. Is it a custom? 640]
472  [Horatio. It is a nipping and an eager air.]
473  [Horatio. It was, as I have seen it in his life,]
474  [Horatio. It would have much amaz'd you.]
475  [Horatio. Look, my lord, it comes!]
476  [Horatio. Most constantly. 450]
477  [Horatio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.]
478  [Horatio. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.]
479  [Horatio. My lord, I did; 425]
480  [Horatio. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.]
481  [Horatio. My lord, the King your father.]
482  [Horatio. Nay, very pale.]
483  [Horatio. No, by no means!]
484  [Horatio. Not I, my lord, by heaven!]
485  [Horatio. Not when I saw't.]
486  [Horatio. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!]
487  [Horatio. O, where, my lord?]
488  [Horatio. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.]
489  [Horatio. Propose the oath, my lord. 905]
490  [Horatio. Season your admiration for a while 400]
491  [Horatio. So have I heard and do in part believe it.]
492  [Horatio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak! 65]
493  [Horatio. That can I.]
494  [Horatio. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.]
495  [Horatio. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave 870]
496  [Horatio. There's no offence, my lord.]
497  [Horatio. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.]
498  [Horatio. Two nights together had these gentlemen 405]
499  [Horatio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.]
500  [Horatio. Well, sit we down,]
501  [Horatio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night]
502  [Horatio. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,]
503  [Horatio. What is't, my lord? We will. 890]
504  [Horatio. What news, my lord?]
505  [Horatio. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.]
506  [Horatio.[within] My lord, my lord!]
507  [How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself]
508  [How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable]
509  [Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother]
510  [I could a tale unfold whose lightest word]
511  [I do not set my life at a pin's fee;]
512  [I do beseech you give him leave to go.]
513  [I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!]
514  [I have sworn't. 850]
515  [I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;]
516  [I made to her in marriage, and to decline]
517  [I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.]
518  ['I saw him enter such a house of sale,']
519  [I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,]
520  [I say, away! – Go on. I'll follow thee.]
521  [I shall not look upon his like again. 395]
522  [I stay too long. But here my father comes.]
523  [I think it was to see my mother's wedding.]
524  [I will requite your loves. So, fare you well. 470]
525  [I would know that.]
526  [I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth]
527  [I'll cross it, though it blast me. – Stay illusion! 145]
528  [I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape]
529  [I'll visit you.]
530  [I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,]
531  [If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,]
532  [If she unmask her beauty to the moon.]
533  [If there be any good thing to be done,]
534  [If thou art privy to thy country's fate,]
535  [If thou didst ever thy dear father love-]
536  [If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,]
537  [If with too credent ear you list his songs,]
538  [If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,]
539  [If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,]
540  [Importing the surrender of those lands]
541  [In dreadful secrecy impart they did,]
542  [In equal scale weighing delight and dole,]
543  [In filial obligation for some term]
544  [In going back to school in Wittenberg,]
545  [In honourable fashion.]
546  [In obstinate condolement is a course]
547  [In the dead vast and middle of the night]
548  [In the most high and palmy state of Rome, 130]
549  [In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,]
550  [In this distracted globe. Remember thee? 835]
551  [In which the majesty of buried Denmark]
552  [Is by a forged process of my death]
553  [Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,]
554  [Is not this something more than fantasy?]
555  [It fits your wisdom so far to believe it]
556  [Is the main motive of our preparations,]
557  [It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.']
558  [It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you. 885]
559  [It is most retrograde to our desire;]
560  [It is not, nor it cannot come to good.]
561  [It lifted up it head and did address]
562  [It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,]
563  [It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.]
564  [It waves you to a more removed ground.]
565  [Itself to motion, like as it would speak;]
566  [Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,]
567  [King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?]
568  [Laertes. Farewell. Exit.]
569  [Laertes. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well 570]
570  [Laertes. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,]
571  [Laertes. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.]
572  [Laertes. My dread lord,]
573  [Laertes. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.]
574  [Laertes. O, fear me not!]
575  [Laertes. Think it no more.]
576  [Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,]
577  [Let it be tenable in your silence still;]
578  [Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell 675]
579  [Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman! – 350]
580  [Let not the royal bed of Denmark be 820]
581  [Let us impart what we have seen to-night]
582  [Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know]
583  [Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she]
584  [Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.]
585  [Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, 545]
586  [Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.]
587  [Look you, I'll go pray.]
588  [Lost by his father, with all bands of law,]
589  [Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,]
590  [Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;]
591  [Making night hideous, and we fools of nature]
592  [(Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch]
593  [Marcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.]
594  [Marcellus. 'Tis gone!]
595  [Marcellus. And liegemen to the Dane.]
596  [Marcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,]
597  [Marcellus. Holla, Bernardo! 25]
598  [Marcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,]
599  [Marcellus. How is't, my noble lord?]
600  [Marcellus. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!]
601  [Marcellus. Is it not like the King?]
602  [Marcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock. 180]
603  [Marcellus. It is offended.]
604  [Marcellus. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.]
605  [Marcellus. Look with what courteous action]
606  [Marcellus. Lord Hamlet!]
607  [Marcellus. My good lord!]
608  [Marcellus. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.]
609  [Marcellus. Nay, let's follow him. 730]
610  [Marcellus. No, it is struck. 630]
611  [Marcellus. Nor I, my lord- in faith.]
612  [Marcellus. Nor I, my lord.]
613  [Marcellus. O, farewell, honest soldier.]
614  [Marcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!]
615  [Marcellus. O, wonderful! 860]
616  [Marcellus. Question it, Horatio.]
617  [Marcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan? 160]
618  [Marcellus. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.]
619  [Marcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.]
620  [Marcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,]
621  [Marcellus. We have sworn, my lord, already.]
622  [Marcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night? 30]
623  [Marcellus. You shall not go, my lord.]
624  [Marcellus.[with Bernardo] Arm'd, my lord. 440]
625  [Marcellus.[with Bernardo] Longer, longer. 455]
626  [Marcellus.[with Bernardo] My lord, from head to foot.]
627  [Marcellus.[with Bernardo] We do, my lord.]
628  [Marcellus.[with Horatio] Ay, by heaven, my lord.]
629  [Marcellus.[with Horatio] My lord, we will not.]
630  [Marcellus?]
631  [Mark you,]
632  [May do t' express his love and friending to you, 940]
633  [May give his saying deed; which is no further]
634  [May sweep to my revenge.]
635  [More honour'd in the breach than the observance.]
636  [Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust 810]
637  [Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him]
638  [Must render up myself.]
639  [My custom always of the afternoon,]
640  [My father's brother, but no more like my father]
641  [My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.]
642  [My father- methinks I see my father. 390]
643  [My lord, not I. 895]
644  [My tables! Meet it is I set it down 845]
645  [My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France]
646  [My uncle?]
647  [Nay, come, let's go together. 945]
648  [Neither a borrower nor a lender be;]
649  [Never to speak of this that you have heard:]
650  [No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,]
651  [No more.]
652  [No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day]
653  [No reckoning made, but sent to my account]
654  [No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,]
655  [Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.]
656  [Nor customary suits of solemn black,]
657  [Nor shall you do my ear that violence]
658  [Nor the dejected havior of the visage,]
659  [Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,]
660  [Not of that dye which their investments show, 615]
661  [Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,]
662  [Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.]
663  [Now wears his crown.]
664  [(O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason]
665  [O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there, 785]
666  [O most pernicious woman!]
667  [O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!]
668  [O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power]
669  [O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,]
670  [O, speak!]
671  [Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware]
672  [Occasion smiles upon a second leave. 540]
673  [Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,]
674  [Of general assault.]
675  [Of his affection to me.]
676  [Of his behaviour.]
677  [Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;]
678  [Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;]
679  [Of man and country- 1000]
680  [Of mine own eyes.]
681  [Of these dilated articles allow. [Gives a paper.]]
682  [Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress 230]
683  [Of this post-haste and romage in the land.]
684  [Of unimproved mettle hot and full,]
685  [Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,]
686  [Ophelia. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,]
687  [Ophelia. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, 600]
688  [Ophelia. Do you doubt that?]
689  [Ophelia. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders]
690  [Ophelia. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,]
691  [Ophelia. I shall obey, my lord.]
692  [Ophelia. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love]
693  [Ophelia. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep]
694  [Ophelia. No more but so?]
695  [Ophelia. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.]
696  [Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,' 930]
697  [Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, 595]
698  [Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,]
699  [Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens]
700  [Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!]
701  [Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life 155]
702  [Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open 515]
703  [Or such ambiguous giving out, to note]
704  [Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd 335]
705  [Or thinking by our late dear brother's death]
706  [Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,]
707  [Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff]
708  [Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son. 320]
709  [Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, 220]
710  [Out of his subject; and we here dispatch]
711  [Out of the shot and danger of desire.]
712  [Passing through nature to eternity. 275]
713  [Perchance 'twill walk again.]
714  [Polonius. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well. 965]
715  [Polonius. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,]
716  [Polonius. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?]
717  [Polonius. And let him ply his music.]
718  [Polonius. At 'closes in the consequence'– Ay, marry!]
719  [Polonius. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!]
720  [Polonius. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,]
721  [Polonius. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,]
722  [Polonius. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.]
723  [Polonius. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.]
724  [Polonius. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!]
725  [Polonius. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave 260]
726  [Polonius. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby]
727  [Polonius. Marry, well bethought!]
728  [Polonius. Marry, sir, here's my drift,]
729  [Polonius. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,]
730  [Polonius. Observe his inclination in yourself.]
731  [Polonius. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.]
732  [Polonius. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you? 575]
733  [Polonius. Wherefore should you do this?]
734  [Polonius. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!]
735  [Polonius. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo, 950]
736  [Possess it merely. That it should come to this!]
737  [Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth, 775]
738  [Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.]
739  [Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,]
740  [Reynaldo. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and]
741  [Reynaldo. As gaming, my lord.]
742  [Reynaldo. Ay, my lord,]
743  [Reynaldo. Ay, very well, my lord.]
744  [Reynaldo. But, my good lord- 985]
745  [Reynaldo. Good my lord! [Going.]]
746  [Reynaldo. I shall, my lord. 1025]
747  [Reynaldo. I will, my lord.]
748  [Reynaldo. My lord, I did intend it.]
749  [Reynaldo. My lord, I have.]
750  [Reynaldo. My lord, that would dishonour him.]
751  [Reynaldo. Very good, my lord.]
752  [Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.]
753  [Reynaldo. Well, my lord.]
754  [Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?]
755  [See you now-]
756  [Seek for thy noble father in the dust.]
757  [Seem to me all the uses of this world!]
758  [Set your entreatments at a higher rate]
759  [Shall in the general censure take corruption]
760  [Shall you my son. You have me, have you not? 1020]
761  [Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes, 115]
762  [She married. O, most wicked speed, to post 360]
763  [Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,]
764  [Since nature cannot choose his origin, —]
765  [Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,]
766  [So by his father lost; and this, I take it,]
767  [So excellent a king, that was to this]
768  [So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,]
769  [So grace and mercy at your most need help you,]
770  [So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.]
771  [So horridly to shake our disposition]
772  [So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,]
773  [So oft it chances in particular men]
774  [So nightly toils the subject of the land,]
775  [So to seduce! – won to his shameful lust]
776  [So, by my former lecture and advice,]
777  [So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:]
778  [Soil our addition; and indeed it takes]
779  [Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes]
780  [Speak of it! Stay, and speak! – Stop it, Marcellus!]
781  [Speak to me.]
782  [Speak to me.]
783  [[Spreads his arms.]]
784  [Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me 415]
785  [Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.]
786  [Such as it is; and for my own poor part,]
787  [Such was the very armour he had on]
788  [Swear by my sword.]
789  [Swear by my sword.]
790  [Swear.]
791  [Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive]
792  [Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. 555]
793  [Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,]
794  [Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;]
795  [Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd]
796  [Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,]
797  [Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies]
798  [Than I to Hercules. Within a month,]
799  [Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, 610]
800  [Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. 920]
801  [Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. 250]
802  [Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,]
803  [Than that which dearest father bears his son]
804  [Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.]
805  [Than your particular demands will touch it. 960]
806  [That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,]
807  [That are so fortified against our story,]
808  [That beetles o'er his base into the sea,]
809  [That ever I was born to set it right!]
810  ['That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,]
811  [That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound]
812  [That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature 340]
813  [That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,]
814  [That he is open to incontinency.]
815  [That he might not beteem the winds of heaven 345]
816  [That it went hand in hand even with the vow]
817  [That looks so many fadoms to the sea 710]
818  [That may to thee do ease, and, grace to me, 150]
819  [That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;]
820  [That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, 770]
821  [That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?]
822  [That swift as quicksilver it courses through]
823  [That they do know my son, come you more nearer]
824  [That they may seem the taints of liberty,]
825  [That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,]
826  [That was and is the question of these wars.]
827  [That we with wisest sorrow think on him]
828  [That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,]
829  [That you know aught of me- this is not to do,]
830  [That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,]
831  [That youth and observation copied there,]
832  [That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly 980]
833  [That, if again this apparition come,]
834  [That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,]
835  [Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!]
836  [The apparition comes. I knew your father. 420]
837  [The bell then beating one- 50]
838  [The better to beguile. This is for all:]

841  [The chariest maid is prodigal enough 520]
842  [[The cock crows.]]
843  [The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,]
844  [The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,]
845  [The form of plausive manners, that these men]
846  [The glowworm shows the matin to be near]
847  [The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead]
848  [The hand more instrumental to the mouth,]
849  [The head is not more native to the heart,]
850  [The inward service of the mind and soul]
851  [The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out]
852  [The leperous distilment; whose effect]
853  [The lists, and full proportions are all made]

855  [The natural gates and alleys of the body, 805]
856  [The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike, 185]
857  [The perfume and suppliance of a minute;]
858  [The pith and marrow of our attribute. 650]
859  [The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste. 15]
860  [The safety and health of this whole state, 505]
861  [The source of this our watch, and the chief head]
862  [The serpent that did sting thy father's life]
863  [The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;]
864  [The time is out of joint. O cursed spite]
865  [The triumph of his pledge.]
866  [The very place puts toys of desperation,]
867  [The virtue of his will; but you must fear, 500]
868  [The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.]
869  [The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd]
870  [The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,]
871  [Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,]
872  [Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain]
873  [There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,]
874  [There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,]
875  [There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse; 1010]
876  [Therefore I have entreated him along, 35]
877  [Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,]
878  [Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride, 100]
879  [These but the trappings and the suits of woe.]
880  [These hands are not more like.]
881  [They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase]
882  [[They swear.]]
883  [This above all- to thine own self be true,]
884  [This bodes some strange eruption to our state. 85]
885  [This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet]
886  [This heavy-headed revel east and west 645]
887  [This marvel to you.]
888  ['This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth]
889  [This present object made probation.]
890  [This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.]
891  [This unprevailing woe, and think of us 310]
892  [Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,]
893  [Thou canst not then be false to any man.]
894  [Thou com'st in such a questionable shape]
895  [Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,]

897  [Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,]
898  [Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand]

929  [To what I shall unfold.]
930  [To you alone. 690]
931  [To youth and liberty.]
932  [Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief, 285]
933  [Together with remembrance of ourselves.]
934  [Together with that fair and warlike form 60]
935  [Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,]
936  [Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.]
937  [Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd, 815]
938  [Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!]
939  [Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.]
940  [Unto our climature and countrymen.]
941  [Unto the voice and yielding of that body]
942  [Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,]
943  [Upon a fearful summons. I have heard]
944  [Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor]
945  [Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.]
946  [Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,]
947  [Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,]
948  [Upon the witness of these gentlemen,]
949  [Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands]
950  [Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.]

958  [We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.]
959  [Well may it sort that this portentous figure]
960  [Well ratified by law and heraldry,]
961  [What I have said to you.]
962  [What company, at what expense; and finding]
963  [What does this mean, my lord?]
964  [What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank]
965  [What is between you? Give me up the truth. 585]
966  [What might be toward, that this sweaty haste]
967  [What think you on't? 70]
968  [What we two nights have seen.]
969  [What wouldst thou have, Laertes?]
970  [What, is Horatio there ?]
971  [When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames]
972  [When he th' ambitious Norway combated.]
973  [When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul]
974  [When yond same star that's westward from the pole]
975  [Where we shall find him most conveniently.]
976  [Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,]
977  [Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,]
978  [Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.]
979  [Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,]
980  [Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,]
981  [Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,]
982  [Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,]
983  [Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,]
984  [Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;]
985  [Which happily foreknowing may avoid,]
986  [Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason]
987  [Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,]
988  [Who hath reliev'd you?]
989  [Who is't that can inform me? 95]
990  [Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears]
991  [Whose image even but now appear'd to us,]
992  [Why seems it so particular with thee?]
993  [Why should we in our peevish opposition]
994  [Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task]
995  [Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,]
996  [Why this same strict and most observant watch]
997  [Will sate itself in a celestial bed]

999  [With all my imperfections on my head.]
1000  [With all my love I do commend me to you;]
1001  [With almost all the holy vows of heaven.]
1002  [With an attent ear, till I may deliver]
1003  [With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,]
1004  [With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,]
1005  [With juice of cursed hebona in a vial, 800]
1006  [With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.]
1007  [With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,]
1008  [With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!]
1009  [With this affair along. For all, our thanks.]
1010  [With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? 685]
1011  [With us to watch the minutes of this night,]
1012  [With which she followed my poor father's body]
1013  [With windlasses and with assays of bias,]
1014  [Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd]
1015  [With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-]
1016  [Within the book and volume of my brain,]
1017  [Without more motive, into every brain]
1018  [Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven]
1019  [Without the sensible and true avouch]
1020  [Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,]
1021  [Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle; 355]
1022  [Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.]
1023  [Yea, from the table of my memory]
1024  [Yes, faith, heartily.]
1025  [Yet now I must confess, that duty done,]
1026  [Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature 205]
1027  [You are the most immediate to our throne,]
1028  [You do not understand yourself so clearly]
1029  [You cannot speak of reason to the Dane 245]
1030  [You laying these slight sullies on my son]
1031  [You must not take for fire. From this time]
1032  [You must not put another scandal on him,]
1033  [You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?]
1034  [You, as your business and desires shall point you, 875]
1035  [You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,]
1036  [Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth; 1015]
1037  [Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone 215]
1038  [Your leave and favour to return to France;]
1039  [Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.]
1040  [Your party in converse, him you would sound,]
1041  [gentleman.' 1005]
0  [Horatio. That can I.]
1  [My lord, not I. 895]
2  [That looks so many fadoms to the sea 710]
3  [That beetles o'er his base into the sea,]
4  [Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,]
5  [Enter Laertes and Ophelia.]
6  [Polonius. And let him ply his music.]
7  [And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd]
8  [Marcellus. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.]
9  [Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;]
10  [Ophelia. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,]
11  [Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd]
12  [So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,]
13  [Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd]
14  [Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd, 815]
15  [An understanding simple and unschool'd; 300]
16  [And carriage of the article design'd,]
17  [Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,]
18  [Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,]
19  [Was gaged by our king; which had return'd]
20  [A sable silver'd.]
21  [Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd]
22  [The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd]
23  [Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,]
24  [But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,]
25  [Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd 335]
26  [The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead]
27  [Bernardo. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.]
28  [The source of this our watch, and the chief head]
29  [With all my imperfections on my head.]
30  [But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,]
31  [And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,]
32  [Will sate itself in a celestial bed]
33  [Marcellus. It is offended.]
34  [Hamlet. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.]
35  [And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed]
36  [Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,]
37  [Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,]
38  [Hamlet. Pale or red?]
39  [Horatio. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.]
40  [When he th' ambitious Norway combated.]
41  [Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,]
42  [Have heaven and earth together demonstrated]
43  [The memory be green, and that it us befitted]
44  [Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid]
45  [Horatio. My lord, I did; 425]
46  [In dreadful secrecy impart they did,]
47  [Which happily foreknowing may avoid,]
48  [But if't be he I mean, he's very wild]
49  [A little month, or ere those shoes were old]
50  [And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,]
51  [Francisco. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,]
52  [Hamlet. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.]
53  [To what I shall unfold.]
54  [As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,']
55  [Seem to me all the uses of this world!]
56  [Reynaldo. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and]
57  [But to recover of us, by strong hand]
58  [Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand]
59  [So nightly toils the subject of the land,]
60  [Of this post-haste and romage in the land.]
61  [You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,]
62  [Horatio. Do, if it will not stand.]
63  [And each particular hair to stand on end 755]
64  [For loan oft loses both itself and friend,]
65  [Polonius. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.]
66  [Hamlet.[aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!]
67  [The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,]
68  [That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound]
69  [It waves you to a more removed ground.]
70  [Hamlet. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.]
71  [Horatio. Friends to this ground.]
72  [Your party in converse, him you would sound,]
73  [His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!]
74  [Hamlet. O God! 760]
75  [Form of the thing, each word made true and good,]
76  [It is not, nor it cannot come to good.]
77  [A savageness in unreclaimed blood,]
78  [As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,]
79  [Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,]
80  [Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;]
81  [Upon a fearful summons. I have heard]
82  [Never to speak of this that you have heard:]
83  [Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,]
84  ['Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,]
85  [Bernardo. Have you had quiet guard?]
86  [Marcellus. My good lord!]
87  [Laertes. My dread lord,]
88  [Reynaldo. But, my good lord- 985]
89  [Marcellus. Nor I, my lord.]
90  [Marcellus. How is't, my noble lord?]
91  [Marcellus.[with Bernardo] Arm'd, my lord. 440]
92  [Reynaldo. Very good, my lord.]
93  [Horatio. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,]
94  [Horatio.[within] My lord, my lord!]
95  [Horatio. There's no offence, my lord.]
96  [Horatio. O, where, my lord?]
97  [Laertes. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.]
98  [Reynaldo. As gaming, my lord.]
99  [Ophelia. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, 600]
100  [Horatio. Propose the oath, my lord. 905]
101  [Reynaldo. I shall, my lord. 1025]
102  [Reynaldo. Well, my lord.]
103  [Reynaldo. Ay, very well, my lord.]
104  [Reynaldo. I will, my lord.]
105  [What does this mean, my lord?]
106  [Marcellus.[with Horatio] Ay, by heaven, my lord.]
107  [Marcellus.[with Bernardo] We do, my lord.]
108  [Marcellus. You shall not go, my lord.]
109  [Marcellus. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!]
110  [Horatio. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.]
111  [Horatio. What news, my lord?]
112  [Horatio. Do not, my lord!]
113  [Reynaldo. Ay, my lord,]
114  [Ophelia. I shall obey, my lord.]
115  [Horatio. A truant disposition, good my lord. 375]
116  [I could a tale unfold whose lightest word]
117  [So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:]
118  [Father's Ghost.[beneath] Swear by his sword.]
119  [Hamlet. Upon my sword.]
120  [And lay your hands again upon my sword.]
121  [Swear by my sword.]
122  [Swear by my sword.]
123  [But even then the morning cock crew loud,]
124  [Bernardo. He.]
125  [Let not the royal bed of Denmark be 820]
126  [Neither a borrower nor a lender be;]
127  [But this eternal blazon must not be]
128  [Gertrude. If it be,]
129  [Hamlet. Then saw you not his face?]
130  [As he in his particular act and place 510]
131  [Francisco. Bernardo hath my place.]
132  [A double blessing is a double grace;]
133  [Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,]
134  [He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.]
135  [If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,]
136  [Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;]
137  [So, by my former lecture and advice,]
138  [Break we our watch up; and by my advice]
139  [There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,]
140  [My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France]
141  [Your leave and favour to return to France;]
142  [Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.]
143  [More honour'd in the breach than the observance.]
144  [Nor shall you do my ear that violence]
145  [To offer it the show of violence;]
146  [Be something scanter of your maiden presence.]
147  [He closes with you in this consequence:]
148  [To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.]
149  [The lists, and full proportions are all made]
150  [And recks not his own rede. 535]
151  [Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride, 100]
152  [I do not set my life at a pin's fee;]
153  [Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.]
154  [And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!]
155  [Why seems it so particular with thee?]
156  [Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!]
157  [In this distracted globe. Remember thee? 835]
158  [But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?]
159  [Go on. I'll follow thee.]
160  [I say, away! – Go on. I'll follow thee.]
161  [The serpent that did sting thy father's life]
162  [Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life 155]
163  [Horatio. It was, as I have seen it in his life,]
164  [Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,]
165  [And prey on garbage. 795]
166  [With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,]
167  [Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.]
168  [Nor the dejected havior of the visage,]
169  [He hath not fail'd to pester us with message]
170  [Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,]
171  [Ghost cries under the stage.]
172  [The triumph of his pledge.]
173  ['Tis strange. 80]
174  [And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge 825]
175  [Horatio. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!]
176  [Hamlet. 'Tis very strange.]
177  [May sweep to my revenge.]
178  [Polonius. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.]
179  [Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she]
180  [Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,]
181  [With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,]
182  [These hands are not more like.]
183  [The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike, 185]
184  [Bernardo. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.]
185  [Horatio. Nay, very pale.]
186  ['I saw him enter such a house of sale,']
187  [For it is as the air, invulnerable,]
188  [How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable]
189  [Be thy intents wicked or charitable,]
190  [Hamlet. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!]
191  [My uncle?]
192  [Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle; 355]
193  [Horatio. Season your admiration for a while 400]
194  [Bernardo. Sit down awhile, 40]
195  [In equal scale weighing delight and dole,]
196  [When yond same star that's westward from the pole]
197  [Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,]
198  [So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,]
199  [Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.]
200  [Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.]
201  [Father's Ghost. Mark me.]
202  [Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.]
203  [Who is't that can inform me? 95]
204  [That may to thee do ease, and, grace to me, 150]
205  [If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,]
206  [Speak to me.]
207  [Speak to me.]
208  [Of his affection to me.]
209  [Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me 415]
210  [It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.']
211  [King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?]
212  [By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me! —]
213  [Hamlet. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.]
214  [Polonius. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!]
215  [Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, 220]
216  [To reason most absurd, whose common theme]
217  [So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.]
218  [Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,]
219  [You must not take for fire. From this time]
220  [In the most high and palmy state of Rome, 130]
221  [Hamlet. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.]
222  [Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come. 325]
223  [I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!]
224  [That, if again this apparition come,]
225  [Horatio. Have after. To what issue will this come?]
226  [Father's Ghost. My hour is almost come,]
227  [Hamlet. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.]
228  [But come!]
229  [Marcellus. And liegemen to the Dane.]
230  [You cannot speak of reason to the Dane 245]
231  [Act I, Scene 1.]
232  [Act I, Scene 2.]
233  [Act I, Scene 3.]
234  [Act I, Scene 5.]
235  [Act I, Scene 4.]
236  [Act II, Scene 1.]
237  [Claudius. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,]
238  [I made to her in marriage, and to decline]
239  [To those of mine! 790]
240  [The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;]
241  [Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.]
242  [Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,]
243  [The bell then beating one- 50]
244  [If there be any good thing to be done,]
245  [Yet now I must confess, that duty done,]
246  [Marcellus. 'Tis gone!]
247  [To you alone. 690]
248  [Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone 215]
249  [For nature crescent does not grow alone 495]
250  [Hamlet. From top to toe?]
251  [You are the most immediate to our throne,]
252  [These but the trappings and the suits of woe.]
253  [To be contracted in one brow of woe,]
254  [Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,]
255  [I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape]
256  [Thou com'st in such a questionable shape]
257  [To business with the King, more than the scope]
258  [William Shakespeare]
259  [Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware]
260  [But to my mind, though I am native here]
261  [And much offence too. Touching this vision here,]
262  [Bernardo. 'Tis here!]
263  [Horatio. 'Tis here!]
264  [That youth and observation copied there,]
265  [Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,]
266  [Hamlet. I would I had been there.]
267  [What, is Horatio there ?]
268  [Bernardo. Who's there?]
269  [O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there, 785]
270  [Francisco. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?]
271  [Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre]
272  [And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.]
273  [As if it some impartment did desire]
274  [Out of the shot and danger of desire.]
275  [For every man hath business and desire,]
276  [It is most retrograde to our desire;]
277  [Before You visit him, to make inquire]
278  [No more.]
279  [Laertes. Think it no more.]
280  [But what is your affair in Elsinore? 380]
281  [Well may it sort that this portentous figure]
282  [Have you so slander any moment leisure 620]
283  [Making night hideous, and we fools of nature]
284  [Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature 205]
285  [Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature]
286  [That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature 340]
287  [A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, 305]
288  [A violet in the youth of primy nature,]
289  [They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase]
290  [Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, 595]
291  [Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,]
292  [Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,]
293  [For food and diet, to some enterprise]
294  [Hamlet. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else? 830]
295  [As any the most vulgar thing to sense,]
296  [Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.]
297  [In obstinate condolement is a course]
298  [To tell the secrets of my prison house, 750]
299  [There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse; 1010]
300  [Hamlet. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse, 635]
301  [If thou art privy to thy country's fate,]
302  [Set your entreatments at a higher rate]
303  ['Tis told me he hath very oft of late]
304  [Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,]
305  [The safety and health of this whole state, 505]
306  [This bodes some strange eruption to our state. 85]
307  [As it doth well appear unto our state,]
308  [The time is out of joint. O cursed spite]
309  [As of a father; for let the world take note]
310  [Or such ambiguous giving out, to note]
311  [The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste. 15]
312  [What might be toward, that this sweaty haste]
313  [The pith and marrow of our attribute. 650]
314  [The perfume and suppliance of a minute;]
315  [Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, 545]
316  [Give it an understanding but no tongue.]
317  [But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!]
318  [This above all- to thine own self be true,]
319  [Horatio. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;]
320  [Occasion smiles upon a second leave. 540]
321  [By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?]
322  [Polonius. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave 260]
323  [Reynaldo. My lord, I have.]
324  [But he's an arrant knave.]
325  [Horatio. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave 870]
326  [And thy commandment all alone shall live 840]
327  [Horatio. Before my God, I might not this believe]
328  [Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive]
329  [Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,]
330  [Horatio. I think it lacks of twelve.]
331  [As meditation or the thoughts of love,]
332  [And with no less nobility of love]
333  [Ophelia. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love]
334  [If thou didst ever thy dear father love-]
335  [As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.]
336  [No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,]
337  [With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,]
338  [Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,]
339  [Horatio. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.]
340  [Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief, 285]
341  [Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;]
342  [Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff]
343  [[A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.]]
344  [Gertrude. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off, 270]
345  [Francisco. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.]
346  [Polonius. Observe his inclination in yourself.]
347  [Given private time to you, and you yourself]
348  [Being a thing immortal as itself? 700]
349  [Horatio. As thou art to thyself. 75]
350  [Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,]
351  [Must render up myself.]
352  [How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself]
353  [Horatio! – or I do forget myself.]
354  [Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,]
355  [That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, 770]
356  [Comes armed through our watch, so like the King]
357  [Marcellus. Is it not like the King?]
358  [Bernardo. Long live the King!]
359  [I think it was to see my mother's wedding.]
360  [What company, at what expense; and finding]
361  [Horatio. And then it started, like a guilty thing]
362  [Bernardo. I have seen nothing.]
363  [At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,]
364  [Horatio. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.]
365  [Even in their promise, as it is a-making,]
366  [That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?]
367  [As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,]
368  [Polonius. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,]
369  [Awake the god of day; and at his warning, 175]
370  [Reynaldo. Good my lord! [Going.]]
371  [Father's Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing 740]
372  [The canker galls the infants of the spring]
373  [Francisco. Not a mouse stirring.]
374  [Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.]
375  [Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting; 490]
376  [The bird of dawning singeth all night long;]
377  [Hamlet. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?]
378  [Therefore I have entreated him along, 35]
379  [But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?]
380  [Believe so much in him, that he is young,]
381  [In going back to school in Wittenberg,]
382  [I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.]
383  [And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,]
384  [Appears before them and with solemn march 410]
385  [And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch]
386  [Out of his subject; and we here dispatch]
387  [And I with them the third night kept the watch;]
388  [(Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch]
389  [With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.]
390  [Why this same strict and most observant watch]
391  [Without the sensible and true avouch]
392  [The chariest maid is prodigal enough 520]
393  [That swift as quicksilver it courses through]
394  [Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,]
395  [(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),]
396  [Or thinking by our late dear brother's death]
397  [Claudius. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death]
398  [Is by a forged process of my death]
399  [Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,]
400  [And hears it roar beneath.]
401  [Horatio. In faith,]
402  [Than I to Hercules. Within a month,]
403  [Marcellus. Nor I, my lord- in faith.]
404  [By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-]
405  [Giving more light than heat, extinct in both 605]
406  [Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!]
407  ['This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth]
408  [Extorted treasure in the womb of earth]
409  [For he himself is subject to his birth.]
410  [I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth]
411  [Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.]
412  [Holding a weak supposal of our worth,]
413  [The hand more instrumental to the mouth,]
414  [And in the morn and liquid dew of youth 525]
415  [Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth, 775]
416  [What is between you? Give me up the truth. 585]
417  [Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth; 1015]
418  [O, speak!]
419  [Itself to motion, like as it would speak;]
420  [Horatio. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak! 65]
421  [Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!]
422  [Nor customary suits of solemn black,]
423  [Marcellus. It faded on the crowing of the cock. 180]
424  [Marcellus. No, it is struck. 630]
425  [Does not divide the Sunday from the week.]
426  [And with a larger tether may he walk]
427  [Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.]
428  [And curd, like eager droppings into milk,]
429  [What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank]
430  [Ophelia. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,]
431  [In which the majesty of buried Denmark]
432  [Marcellus. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.]
433  [A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark]
434  [Hamlet. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark]
435  [From whence though willingly I came to Denmark]
436  [And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.]
437  [Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task]
438  [We do it wrong, being so majestical,]
439  [Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal. 665]
440  [Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.]
441  [With juice of cursed hebona in a vial, 800]
442  [Horatio. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.]
443  [But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.]
444  [That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,]
445  [Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;]
446  [From that particular fault. The dram of e'il]
447  [The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,]
448  [Bernardo. Last night of all,]
449  [Hamlet. He was a man, take him for all in all.]
450  [The better to beguile. This is for all:]
451  [And so, without more circumstance at all,]
452  [And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all, 465]
453  [That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,]
454  [A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,]
455  [But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,]
456  [Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, 670]
457  [Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell 675]
458  [Polonius. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!]
459  [Laertes. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well 570]
460  [My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.]
461  [Polonius. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well. 965]
462  [Hamlet. I am glad to see you well.]
463  [I will requite your loves. So, fare you well. 470]
464  [Laertes. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.]
465  [Hamlet. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.]
466  [Claudius. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.]
467  [Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill. 190]
468  [Let it be tenable in your silence still;]
469  [Hamlet. It waves me still.]
470  [Hamlet. I will. 735]
471  [Horatio. What is't, my lord? We will. 890]
472  [Horatio. I warr'nt it will.]
473  [And thy best graces spend it at thy will! 265]
474  [Of unimproved mettle hot and full,]
475  [Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.]
476  [Polonius. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,]
477  [Marcellus. O, wonderful! 860]
478  [Hamlet. O my prophetic soul!]
479  [The inward service of the mind and soul]
480  [When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul]
481  [Hamlet. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.]
482  ['That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,]
483  [Do you believe his tenders, as you call them? 590]
484  [That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,]
485  [(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)]
486  [Horatio. Heaven secure him!]
487  [And will not let belief take hold of him]
488  [Horatio. A piece of him.]
489  [Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;]
490  [Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him]
491  [That we with wisest sorrow think on him]
492  [You must not put another scandal on him,]
493  [Addicted so and so'; and there put on him]
494  [This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.]
495  [To our most valiant brother. So much for him. 225]
496  [Reynaldo. My lord, that would dishonour him.]
497  [Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].]
498  [Marcellus. Nay, let's follow him. 730]
499  [Marcellus. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.]
500  [To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom]
501  [And to the manner born, it is a custom]
502  [Horatio. Is it a custom? 640]
503  [No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,]
504  [In filial obligation for some term]
505  [Together with that fair and warlike form 60]
506  [And there assume some other, horrible form 705]
507  [To cast thee up again. What may this mean 680]
508  [For the apparel oft proclaims the man,]
509  [Holds such an enmity with blood of man]
510  [Thou canst not then be false to any man.]
511  [He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.]
512  ['Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-]
513  [gentleman.' 1005]
514  [Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman! – 350]
515  [O most pernicious woman!]
516  [Marcellus. Shall I strike at it with my partisan? 160]
517  [Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden]
518  [What we two nights have seen.]
519  [Hamlet. Never to speak of this that you have seen.]
520  [Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,]
521  [The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.]
522  [The form of plausive manners, that these men]
523  [So oft it chances in particular men]
524  [Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.]
525  [Hamlet. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,]
526  [Come hither, gentlemen, 910]
527  [Horatio. Two nights together had these gentlemen 405]
528  [Upon the witness of these gentlemen,]
529  [Unto our climature and countrymen.]
530  [Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open 515]
531  [Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,]
532  [That he might not beteem the winds of heaven 345]
533  [With almost all the holy vows of heaven.]
534  [Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven]
535  [Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven]
536  [Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,]
537  [It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,]
538  [Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,]
539  [Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,]
540  [Horatio. Not I, my lord, by heaven!]
541  [Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!]
542  [Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,]
543  [I shall not look upon his like again. 395]
544  [Perchance 'twill walk again.]
545  [But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!]
546  [Marcellus. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!]
547  [And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again, 330]
548  [[Enter Ghost again.]]
549  [That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;]
550  [O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!]
551  [And we beseech you, bend you to remain]
552  [Without more motive, into every brain]
553  [Within the book and volume of my brain,]
554  [Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain]
555  [To his confine; and of the truth herein]
556  [Since nature cannot choose his origin, —]
557  [Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,]
558  [Such was the very armour he had on]
559  [And prologue to the omen coming on, 140]
560  [To put an antic disposition on), 925]
561  [And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.]
562  [In honourable fashion.]
563  [But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,]
564  [I'll cross it, though it blast me. – Stay illusion! 145]
565  [This present object made probation.]
566  [Horatio. He waxes desperate with imagination. 725]
567  [To show my duty in your coronation, 255]
568  [The very place puts toys of desperation,]
569  [And they in France of the best rank and station]
570  [And keep you in the rear of your affection,]
571  [Marcellus. Look with what courteous action]
572  [According to the phrase or the addition]
573  [Why should we in our peevish opposition]
574  [So horridly to shake our disposition]
575  [Shall in the general censure take corruption]
576  [By this encompassment and drift of question]
577  [By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, 655]
578  [For what we know must be, and is as common]
579  [Hamlet. Ay, madam, it is common.]
580  [And why such daily cast of brazen cannon]
581  [Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,]
582  [My custom always of the afternoon,]
583  [If she unmask her beauty to the moon.]
584  [Horatio. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon. 385]
585  [Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son. 320]
586  [Than that which dearest father bears his son]
587  [But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-]
588  [You laying these slight sullies on my son]
589  [(O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason]
590  [Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,]
591  [Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason]
592  [Horatio. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season]
593  [Hamlet. If it assume my noble father's person,]
594  [The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,]
595  [Hamlet. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.]
596  [His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;]
597  [Horatio. Well, sit we down,]
598  [And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,]
599  [My tables! Meet it is I set it down 845]
600  [As are companions noted and most known]
601  [Now wears his crown.]
602  [As if increase of appetite had grown]
603  [Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?]
604  [Bernardo. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.]
605  [That you know aught of me- this is not to do,]
606  [He may not, as unvalued persons do,]
607  [Polonius. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.]
608  [Do not as some ungracious pastors do,]
609  [And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?]
610  [Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.]
611  [Polonius. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo, 950]
612  [Francisco. Bernardo? 5]
613  [Marcellus. Holla, Bernardo! 25]
614  [Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.]
615  [I do beseech you give him leave to go.]
616  [Horatio. Be rul'd. You shall not go.]
617  [As infinite as man may undergo-]
618  [Hamlet. Saw? who?]
619  [Hamlet. In my mind's eye, Horatio.]
620  [And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? 370]
621  [There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,]
622  [Hamlet. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,]
623  [Bernardo. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio. 55]
624  [Marcellus. Question it, Horatio.]
625  [Marcellus. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.]
626  [Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!]
627  [Hamlet. His beard was grizzled- no?]
628  [Bernardo. I think it be no other but e'en so. 125]
629  [Ophelia. No more but so?]
630  [Hamlet. I would not hear your enemy say so,]
631  [Bernardo. It would be spoke to.]
632  [Polonius. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!]
633  [But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.]
634  [Ophelia. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep]
635  [And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,]
636  [And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,]
637  [Horatio. Hail to your lordship! 365]
638  [Horatio. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.]
639  [Hamlet. Why, what should be the fear?]
640  [Almost to jelly with the act of fear,]
641  [Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.]
642  [The virtue of his will; but you must fear, 500]
643  [Hamlet. For God's love let me hear!]
644  [Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.]
645  [Hamlet. Speak. I am bound to hear.]
646  [Father's Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.]
647  [The glowworm shows the matin to be near]
648  [Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.]
649  [Horatio. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.]
650  [Father's Ghost. Swear.]
651  [Father's Ghost.[beneath] Swear.]
652  [Father's Ghost.[beneath] Swear. 935]
653  [Swear.]
654  [Consent to swear.]
655  [[They swear.]]
656  [Drabbing. You may go so far. 975]
657  [Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:]
658  [Being nature's livery, or fortune's star, 660]
659  [Disasters in the sun; and the moist star 135]
660  [And foreign mart for implements of war; 90]
661  [Horatio. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.]
662  [Horatio. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.]
663  [Marcellus.[with Bernardo] Longer, longer. 455]
664  [Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,]
665  [But you must know, your father lost a father;]
666  [Horatio. My lord, the King your father.]
667  [To give these mourning duties to your father;]
668  [The apparition comes. I knew your father. 420]
669  [Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. 250]
670  [My father- methinks I see my father. 390]
671  [My father's brother, but no more like my father]
672  [Hamlet. The King my father?]
673  [God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;]
674  [Nay, come, let's go together. 945]
675  [That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,]
676  ['Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, 280]
677  [Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother]
678  [As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother, 530]
679  [Hamlet. Murther?]
680  [Hamlet. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.]
681  [May give his saying deed; which is no further]
682  [Father's Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.]
683  [Marcellus. O, farewell, honest soldier.]
684  [Of these dilated articles allow. [Gives a paper.]]
685  [That they do know my son, come you more nearer]
686  [Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,]
687  [Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,]
688  [Horatio. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.]
689  [With an attent ear, till I may deliver]
690  [To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever 295]
691  [O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power]
692  [Marcellus. 'Tis gone and will not answer.]
693  [Giving to you no further personal power]
694  [But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.]
695  [Horatio. It is a nipping and an eager air.]
696  [Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,]
697  [Hamlet. I am very glad to see you. – [To Bernardo] Good even, sir. —]
698  [Polonius. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,]
699  [Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor]
700  [Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;]
701  [Marcellus. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,]
702  [Francisco. You come most carefully upon your hour.]
703  [Of his behaviour.]
704  [As it behooves my daughter and your honour.]
705  [And in the porches of my ears did pour]
706  [All. Our duty to your honour.]
707  [Laertes. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,]
708  [With windlasses and with assays of bias,]
709  [To the inheritance of Fortinbras,]
710  [His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,]
711  [Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,]
712  [Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads]
713  [To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,]
714  [Do not for ever with thy vailed lids]
715  [Hamlet. Hold off your hands! 715]
716  [And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands 120]
717  [Importing the surrender of those lands]
718  [Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands 105]
719  [A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."]
720  [Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands]
721  [O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,]
722  [As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,]
723  [Carve for himself, for on his choice depends]
724  [I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,]
725  [Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,]
726  [Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies]
727  [His further gait herein, in that the levies,]
728  [Soil our addition; and indeed it takes]
729  [Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.]
730  [Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.]
731  [When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames]
732  [Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes 995]
733  [Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes]
734  [I stay too long. But here my father comes.]
735  [Horatio. Look, my lord, it comes!]
736  [Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,]
737  [And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,]
738  [As harbingers preceding still the fates]
739  [At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark. [Writes.]]
740  [What wouldst thou have, Laertes?]
741  [And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,]
742  [You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?]
743  [Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes, 115]
744  [Together with remembrance of ourselves.]
745  [In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,]
746  [Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,]
747  [Of mine own eyes.]
748  [By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,]
749  [Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.]
750  [If with too credent ear you list his songs,]
751  [And what so poor a man as Hamlet is]
752  [Father's Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;]
753  [And let us hear Bernardo speak of this. 45]
754  [Polonius. Wherefore should you do this?]
755  [Possess it merely. That it should come to this!]
756  [So excellent a king, that was to this]
757  [Hamlet. But where was this?]
758  [To tell us this.]
759  [Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris; 955]
760  [With this affair along. For all, our thanks.]
761  [Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,]
762  [Hamlet. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.']
763  [With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? 685]
764  [[Spreads his arms.]]
765  [Horatio. No, by no means!]
766  [Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens]
767  [Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;]
768  [Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.]
769  [Is the main motive of our preparations,]
770  [[Ghost beckons.] 720]
771  [But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips 970]
772  [And let us once again assail your ears,]
773  [Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears]
774  [Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears]
775  [That was and is the question of these wars.]
776  [Ophelia. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders]
777  [As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,]
778  [Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,]
779  [It lifted up it head and did address]
780  [Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress 230]
781  [Hamlet. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats]
782  [With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!]
783  [Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;]
784  [With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-]
785  [But mere implorators of unholy suits,]
786  [Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, Voltemand, Cornelius, Lords, and Attendants].]
787  [And even the like precurse of fierce events,]
788  [Hamlet. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!]
789  [This unprevailing woe, and think of us 310]
790  [Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.]
791  [For your desire to know what is between us,]
792  [Whose image even but now appear'd to us,]
793  [[Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.]]
794  [Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.]
795  [Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.]
796  [[Enter Polonius. ]]
797  [Marcellus?]
798  [Claudius. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?]
799  [Speak of it! Stay, and speak! – Stop it, Marcellus!]
800  [Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.]
801  [Enter Horatio and Marcellus.]
802  [Enter Horatio and Marcellus.]
803  [If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,]
804  [Bernardo. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.]
805  [Have of your audience been most free and bounteous. 580]
806  [Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws]
807  [Marcellus. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,]
808  [[The cock crows.]]
809  [Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.]
810  [What think you on't? 70]
811  [I have sworn't. 850]
812  [Hamlet. Nay, but swear't.]
813  [Hamlet. Ay, marry, is't;]
814  [Horatio. Not when I saw't.]
815  [Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat]
816  [Hamlet. What?]
817  [As may dishonour him- take heed of that;]
818  [Are most select and generous, chief in that. 560]
819  [And for my soul, what can it do to that,]
820  [Ophelia. Do you doubt that?]
821  [I would know that.]
822  [Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat]
823  [Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.]
824  [But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,]
825  [Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,]
826  [Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,]
827  [The leperous distilment; whose effect]
828  [(As I perchance hereafter shall think meet]
829  [Hamlet]
830  [Claudius. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, 290]
831  [Gertrude. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.]
832  [Enter Ghost and Hamlet.]
833  [Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.]
834  [Marcellus. Lord Hamlet!]
835  [Ophelia. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.]
836  [As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.]
837  [Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, 610]
838  [That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,]
839  [This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet]
840  [Ghost beckons Hamlet.]
841  [Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet]
842  [Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
843  [Hamlet]
844  [[Exeunt [all but Hamlet].] 475]
845  [But you'll be secret?]
846  [And with a sudden vigour it doth posset]
847  [Polonius. Marry, sir, here's my drift,]
848  [Hamlet. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift 765]
849  [From our achievements, though perform'd at height,]
850  [Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,' 930]
851  [Bernardo. Well, good night.]
852  [Francisco. Give you good night. 20]
853  [In the dead vast and middle of the night]
854  [Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,]
855  [Horatio. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night]
856  [With us to watch the minutes of this night,]
857  [Hold you the watch to-night?]
858  [Hamlet. I will watch to-night. 460]
859  [Let us impart what we have seen to-night]
860  [Hamlet. Never make known what you have seen to-night.]
861  [Marcellus. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night? 30]
862  [And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,]
863  [Horatio. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.]
864  [Hamlet. Why, right! You are in the right!]
865  [That ever I was born to set it right!]
866  [And vanish'd from our sight.]
867  [If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,]
868  [Polonius. Marry, well bethought!]
869  [But answer made it none. Yet once methought]
870  [Reynaldo. My lord, I did intend it.]
871  [Hamlet. So be it! 855]
872  [So by his father lost; and this, I take it,]
873  [It fits your wisdom so far to believe it]
874  [Horatio. So have I heard and do in part believe it.]
875  [And draw you into madness? Think of it.]
876  [To let you know of it. 435]
877  [And you yourself shall keep the key of it.]
878  [Than your particular demands will touch it. 960]
879  [Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, 195]
880  [But do not go with it!]
881  [Horatio. It beckons you to go away with it,]
882  [Hamlet. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it? 865]
883  [Hamlet. No, you will reveal it.]
884  [Horatio. Good my lord, tell it.]
885  [He may approve our eyes and speak to it.]
886  [Hamlet. Did you not speak to it?]
887  [Horatio. Heaven will direct it.]
888  [Hamlet. It will not speak. Then will I follow it. 695]
889  [And, sister, as the winds give benefit]
890  [It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.]
891  [Father's Ghost. I am thy father's spirit, 745]
892  [Thus much the business is: we have here writ]
893  [Exit.]
894  [Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me. Exit.]
895  [Laertes. Farewell. Exit.]
896  [Give you good night. Exit.]
897  [Of general assault.]
898  [Hamlet. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,]
899  [Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant 110]
900  [And I believe it is a fetch of warrant. 990]
901  [Against yourself. I know you are no truant.]
902  [Hamlet. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.]
903  [A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,]
904  [Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. 555]
905  [But do not dull thy palm with entertainment 550]
906  [Contagious blastments are most imminent.]
907  [Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.]
908  [Against the which a moiety competent]
909  [Do I impart toward you. For your intent 315]
910  [Exeunt.]
911  [Exeunt.]
912  [Exeunt.]
913  [Exeunt.]
914  [No reckoning made, but sent to my account]
915  [Laertes. O, fear me not!]
916  [Marcellus.[with Horatio] My lord, we will not.]
917  [Father's Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.]
918  [Shall you my son. You have me, have you not? 1020]
919  [Marcellus.[with Bernardo] My lord, from head to foot.]
920  [Horatio. In what particular thought to work I know not;]
921  [Father's Ghost. I find thee apt;]
922  [The head is not more native to the heart,]
923  [And I am sick at heart. 10]
924  [And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!]
925  [I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;]
926  [Thy knotted and combined locks to part,]
927  [Such as it is; and for my own poor part,]
928  [We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.]
929  [To make it truster of your own report]
930  [Father's Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, 780]
931  [Hamlet. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast? 915]
932  [By laboursome petition, and at last]
933  [All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past]
934  [A couch for luxury and damned incest.]
935  [Give me one poor request.]
936  [This heavy-headed revel east and west 645]
937  [Enter Ghost.]
938  [To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!]
939  [Enter Ghost.]
940  [Exit Ghost.]
941  [[Exit Ghost.] 165]
942  [Hamlet. Alas, poor ghost!]
943  [She married. O, most wicked speed, to post 360]
944  [Seek for thy noble father in the dust.]
945  [So to seduce! – won to his shameful lust]
946  [Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust 810]
947  [Hamlet. My fate cries out]
948  [By indirections find directions out.]
949  [The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out]
950  [And a most instant tetter bark'd about,]
951  [Who hath reliev'd you?]
952  [Horatio. It would have much amaz'd you.]
953  [Hamlet. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.]
954  [And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?]
955  [Mark you,]
956  [It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you. 885]
957  [And that in way of caution- I must tell you]
958  [But let me hear from you. 485]
959  [Claudius. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?]
960  [Hamlet. And fix'd his eyes upon you?]
961  [What I have said to you.]
962  [Polonius. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you? 575]
963  [With all my love I do commend me to you;]
964  [May do t' express his love and friending to you, 940]
965  [This marvel to you.]
966  [Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,]
967  [So grace and mercy at your most need help you,]
968  [I'll visit you.]
969  [You, as your business and desires shall point you, 875]
970  [Hamlet. Arm'd, say you?]
971  [Lost by his father, with all bands of law,]
972  [Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!]
973  [Bernardo. It was about to speak, when the cock crew. 170]
974  [But I have that within which passeth show-]
975  [Not of that dye which their investments show, 615]
976  [Hamlet. What hour now?]
977  [See you now-]
978  [Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,]
979  [Polonius. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,]
980  [Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know]
981  [That it went hand in hand even with the vow]
982  [Bernardo. Say-]
983  [Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?]
984  [And it must follow, as the night the day, 565]
985  [I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,]
986  [From the first corse till he that died to-day,]
987  [No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day]
988  [For they are actions that a man might play;]
989  [That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,]
990  [And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.]
991  [Look you, I'll go pray.]
992  [Polonius. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?]
993  [Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,]
994  [Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.]
995  [And at the sound it shrunk in haste away 430]
996  [Bernardo. See, it stalks away!]
997  [For bearers of this greeting to old Norway, 235]
998  [Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,]
999  [That he is open to incontinency.]
1000  [Polonius. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby]
1001  [Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,]
1002  [Marcellus. We have sworn, my lord, already.]
1003  [The natural gates and alleys of the body, 805]
1004  [All my smooth body.]
1005  [With which she followed my poor father's body]
1006  [And makes each petty artire in this body]
1007  [Unto the voice and yielding of that body]
1008  [But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;]
1009  [Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. 920]
1010  [Hamlet. What, look'd he frowningly. 445]
1011  [Yes, faith, heartily.]
1012  [Hamlet. I am sorry they offend you, heartily; 880]
1013  [Claudius. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.]
1014  [Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,]
1015  [You do not understand yourself so clearly]
1016  [Horatio. Most constantly. 450]
1017  [Where we shall find him most conveniently.]
1018  [That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly 980]
1019  [Hamlet. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?]
1020  [Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, 210]
1021  [Well ratified by law and heraldry,]
1022  [And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.]
1023  [And our vain blows malicious mockery.]
1024  [And these few precepts in thy memory]
1025  [Yea, from the table of my memory]
1026  [That are so fortified against our story,]
1027  [Of man and country- 1000]
1028  [Polonius. At 'closes in the consequence'– Ay, marry!]
1029  [Is not this something more than fantasy?]
1030  [Marcellus. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,]
1031  [From me, whose love was of that dignity]
1032  [Passing through nature to eternity. 275]
1033  [To his unmast'red importunity.]
1034  [As in their birth, – wherein they are not guilty,]
1035  [To youth and liberty.]
1036  [That they may seem the taints of liberty,]
1037  [As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?]
1038  [And we did think it writ down in our duty]
1039  [Cornelius.[with Voltemand] In that, and all things, will we show our duty. 240]
1040  [Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.]
1041  [Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,]
